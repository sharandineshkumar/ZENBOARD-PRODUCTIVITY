ZenBoard 

ZenBoard is a minimalist, distraction-free productivity dashboard designed to help you organize your thoughts and tasks. Built with a focus on a "calm" design philosophy, it offers essential note-taking and task-management features without the clutter of complex tools.

✨ Features

Core Productivity

Dynamic Notes: Create, edit, and manage rich text notes.

Task Lists: specialized view for to-do lists with checkbox completion.

Archive & Trash: Keep your workspace clean by archiving old items or moving them to the trash. Includes Restore and Permanent Delete functionality.

Customization & UI

Color Coding: Organize notes visually by selecting from 5 calm pastel colors (White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red).

Dark Mode: A fully integrated dark theme that saves your preference automatically.

Responsive Design: A mobile-friendly interface with a collapsible sidebar menu for smaller screens.

 Advanced Functionality

Real-Time Search: Instantly filter through your notes and tasks using the global search bar.

Reminders: Set specific date and time reminders for any note or task.

User Profile: Personalize the app with your name for a dynamic greeting.

Local Storage Persistence: All data is saved instantly to your browser's Local Storage, meaning your notes survive page refreshes and browser restarts without needing a backend database.

 Technologies Used

HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3: Custom properties (variables) for theming, Flexbox/Grid for layout, and media queries for responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6+): DOM manipulation, Event handling, and LocalStorage logic.

Font Awesome: For the UI icons.

Google Fonts: Using the "Lexend" font family for a clean, modern look.
